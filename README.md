<h1 align="center">Hi 👋 I'm Kareem Alkhaleefa</h1>

# 💫 About Me:
I’m a Computer Science student with a strong focus on backend development, automation, and building systems that actually solve real problems. I enjoy working close to the metal on logic-heavy problems while also shipping practical, end-to-end applications.

I care a lot about **discipline, consistency, and real output** — not just theory.

- ⚙️ Building backend services with **FastAPI** and **PostgreSQL**
- 🤖 Designing automation workflows using **Make**, APIs, and custom scripts
- 🧠 Strengthening data structures, algorithms, and systems fundamentals
- 🛠️ Shipping real projects instead of tutorial code
